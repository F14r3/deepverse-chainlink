# DeepVerse

## a platform leveraging both Machine Learning and Blockchain to solve real-world problems

- Developed by: Fredrik Liu, Lupeng Yang, Siyu Chen

Let me make this clear first, machines _do **not**_ learn and smart contracts _are **not**_ smart. Why? Because if we slightly distort the inputs, the output is very likely to become completely wrong. A machine learning algorithm, if trained by 'looking' at an object straight, will fail to recognize the object if rotated unless it was also trained to recognition rotation. (Though Fred is working on 3D equivariant neural networks that can handle translation, rotation, and inversion under Euclidean space). For smart contracts, which are hard coded to do only one thing, has proven to be neither smart nor even enforceable for the case of the DAO. But Blockchain is still an truly innovative approach to governance for networks and machines. 

Our vision at **DeepVerse** is to integrate machine learning and blockchain to do various useful things without being explicited programmed to and yet remain open, transparent, and decentralized.  

## Architecture
- Machine leanring backends
- Model hosting
- Decentralized storage
- API calls via Oracle
- Smart contracts logic

## What problem we are solving! 
Last mile problem! What blockchain can not do!

## Scenerio
verfication for objects on-chain and off-chain without a centralized human intervention or operation

## Attacks
