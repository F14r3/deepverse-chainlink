## Smart Contracts

- DeepVerseDigitalTwin.sol

The contract creates ERC721 standard NFTs, which currently takes the name and url/ipfs location of the file. It was empowered to call oracles to feed its charaters such as labels and the associated accuracies based on machine learning algorithms. The commercial machine learning model API and the external adaptor is available under this repo at 'external-adaptor'. Our machine learning algorithms was made available in a seperate python script, which we have not been able to host it online as a free API call, but the logic and structure will be the same as the external adaptor shows. The features and capabilities were demonstrated in the video.
